# wizardportfolio

This is my attempt at using the Bootstrap CSS Framework to recreate my portfolio. 
I created the following pages: index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html, and tried to incorporate the following items:
navbar, responsive layout, and responsive images.

Had repeated issues with the sticky footer, whenever I reload any of the pages, the footer won't stay completely at the bottom.
